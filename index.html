  <h2>Other Stuff About Me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I am very bad at running but I still keep trying</li>
    <li>I have a day job working in a bank</li>
    <li>I seem to be addicted to a iOS game called Nonograms999</li>
    <li>I really should go to bed earlier than I do</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why this site exists</h2>
  <p>
    I live in Melbourne, Australia. The most locked-down city in the world. My work gave us free access to udemy. I started with data science, then switched to iOS development, now I'm trying to create an app which provides economic indicators, but
    it will need to be marketed, which means creating websites, so now I'm learning web development.
  </p>
  <p>TLDR: I'm down the rabbit hole and there's no turning back now.</p>
